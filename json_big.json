This prevents us using simple comparison operators on them (e.g. last_seq < current_seq).\r\n\r\nPreviously we were using a similar test to determine whether new changes were returned in a call to _changes (if params.since < result.last_seq, fetch more changes). This no longer holds so, instead, fetch more changes if the last_seq returned is not equal to the since\r\nparameter (if params.since != result.last_seq, fetch more changes).\r\n\r\nThere is a danger here of a loop because there is no guarantee that last_seq will be consistent between successive calls to _changes in a clustered CouchDB (rare that this happens but it's possible). I considered a break clause based on the number of documents returned by _changes but filtered replication would scupper that I think.

Here is one recommended way to contribute toward this goal:\r\n\r\n1. Make sure you have an up-to-date git checkout and are on the `master` branch. Build julia with `make`\r\n\r\n2. From the top-level directory, type `rm usr/lib/julia/sys.so`. Deleting `sys.so` will prevent julia from using any pre-compiled functions, increasing the accuracy of the results. (This also makes startup a bit slower, but that's fine for this test---and once you're done, simply typing `make` will cause this file to be rebuilt).\r\n\r\n3. Via the command prompt, navigate to julia's `test/` directory\r\n\r\n4. Start julia with `JULIA_CPU_CORES=1 julia --code-coverage=all --inline=no`. This restricts julia to a single process (accumulating all measurements of coverage together), and prevents inlining (inlining makes it difficult to accurately assess whether a function has been tested).\r\n\r\n5. From the julia prompt, type `include(\"runtests.jl\")`\r\n\r\n6. Once the tests complete successfully, quit julia\r\n\r\n7. Navigate to the `base/` directory.\r\n\r\n8. Browse through the *.jl.cov files, and look for functions (or branches within functions) that either have `0` in front of them (indicating that they were run 0 times), or have `-` in front of them (indicating that they were never compiled).\r\n\r\n9. Write a test that exercises some function that is not adequately covered---you can add your test to one of the existing files, or start a new one, whichever seems most appropriate to you. http://julia.readthedocs.org/en/latest/stdlib/test/ may be helpful in explaining how the testing infrastructure works. Submit the test as a pull request (see [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/JuliaLang/julia/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)).\r\n"},"comment":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/JuliaLang/julia/issues/comments/68488807","html_url":"https://github.com/JuliaLang/julia/issues/9493#issuecomment-68488807","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/JuliaLang/julia/issues/9493","id":68488807,"user":{"login":"timholy","id":1525481,"avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1525481?v=3","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/timholy","html_url":"https://github.com/timholy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timholy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timholy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timholy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timholy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timholy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timholy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timholy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timholy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timholy/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-01-01T15:15:21Z","updated_at":"2015-01-01T15:15:21Z","body":"OK, I've substantially edited the instructions above; with these changes, I _think_ we get reasonably-accurate results, as long as a human parses the `*.jl.cov` files.\r\n\r\nHowever, I'm currently running into #9536, so (for me) currently this doesn't work.\r\n"}},"public":true,"created_at":"2015-01-01T15:15:22Z","org":{"id":743164,"login":"JuliaLang","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/JuliaLang","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/743164?"}}
